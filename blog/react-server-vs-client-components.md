## A Fundamental Shift in React

With the advent of the App Router in Next.js, React introduced a powerful new paradigm: **React Server Components (RSCs)**. This represents a fundamental shift from the traditional client-only approach, allowing developers to choose the optimal rendering environment for each component.

Understanding the distinction between Server Components and Client Components is essential for modern React development.

## Server Components: The New Default

In the Next.js App Router, all components are Server Components by default.

*   **What they are:** Components that render exclusively on the server. Their code is never sent to the browser.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Direct Data Fetching:** Can be `async` and `await` data directly from databases, file systems, or APIs without needing a separate API route. This simplifies data fetching logic immensely.
    *   **Zero Client-Side JavaScript:** They do not add to the client-side JavaScript bundle, resulting in faster initial page loads and better performance.
    *   **Access to Backend Resources:** Can directly use backend-only dependencies (e.g., database clients, private environment variables).
*   **When to use them:**
    *   For fetching data.
    *   For accessing backend resources.
    *   For large components that don't require interactivity.
    *   For pages that are primarily static or read-only.

```jsx
// app/page.tsx (A Server Component by default)
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
  
  return <main><h1>{data.title}</h1></main>;
}
```

## Client Components: For Interactivity

Client Components are the traditional React components we are all familiar with. They enable interactivity and browser-only features.

*   **What they are:** Components that are rendered on the server for the initial load (SSR) but are then "hydrated" in the browser to become interactive. Their JavaScript code is sent to the client.
*   **How to use them:** You must explicitly opt-in by placing the `"use client"` directive at the top of the file.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Interactivity:** Can use state (`useState`), effects (`useEffect`), and event listeners (`onClick`, etc.).
    *   **Access to Browser APIs:** Can use browser-only APIs like `localStorage`, `window`, and `geolocation`.
*   **When to use them:**
    *   For handling user events like clicks and input changes.
    *   For managing state and lifecycle effects.
    *   For components that rely on browser-specific APIs.

```jsx
// components/Counter.tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## The Best of Both Worlds: Composition

The power of this new paradigm lies in how you compose these components. The best practice is to **keep Client Components as small and isolated as possible**.

*   **Server Components can import Client Components:** This is the standard pattern. You build your page with Server Components for data fetching and structure, and then import small, interactive Client Components where needed (e.g., a button, a search bar).
*   **Client Components cannot directly import Server Components:** However, you can pass Server Components as `children` to Client Components, allowing you to "interleave" them.

```jsx
// app/page.tsx (Server Component)
import Counter from './components/Counter'; // Client Component

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>This is a Server Component.</p>
      <Counter /> {/* This part is interactive */}
    </main>
  );
}
```

By strategically deciding where each component should render, you can build applications that are both highly interactive and incredibly performant, delivering the best possible user experience.
